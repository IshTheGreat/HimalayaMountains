function sciBehind() {
	document.getElementById("sci-behind").innerHTML = "Some parts of the mountain range were lifted by the subduction of the Indian Tectonic Plate, causing the Himalayas borders to expand. The foundation of this range was due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. These 2 plates collided, making a convergent boundary. Convergent boundaries are when 2 plates that are moving towards each other in the same direction collide. The softer plate usually would subduct underneath the second plate, which is what the Indian Tectonic Plate had done. As a result, the sedimentary rocks in the Earth's crust were folded, which caused the Himalayas. "

There are over 15,000 glaciers in the Himalayas! Many endangered species live in the Himalayas, such as black bears, snow leopards, and red pandas. Many different ecosystems also lie in the range, such as temperate forests, grasslands, savannas, and rich meadows. There are non-living thins as well, most commonly we find snow. There are harsh climates, and snowfalls every now and then in the winters. Most common agriculture includes rice, wheat, barley, and soybean."
